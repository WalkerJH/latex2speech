\subsection{Stakeholder Profiles}
% This section describes who will benefit from the product both directly and
% indirectly.  Identify stake holders by their roll and describe their needs and
% interactions for that role.
\par
Researchers and academics would be able to benefit from \TeX 2Speech. Since researchers need to stay up to date with current findings, this requires time to read other research papers. With \TeX 2Speech, this can now be done by listening on the go, or while performing other tasks where one could not sit down and read such papers. This could save researchers time and allow them to focus on other aspects of their research.\\
\par
\noindent People with disabilities would benefit in several different ways with \TeX 2Speech. Users that have vision problems would have access to getting important work translated into an audio format. Other users who learn better or focus on audio than physically reading something would also find benefit.

\subsection{Project Priorities}
% Prioritize the major features identified above based on the relative
% return-on-investment.
\par
The projectâ€™s primary priority is to get the ability to add a \LaTeX\ file into a converter and get it to successfully read the major \LaTeX\ commands and environments. Once this has been completed, secondary priorities will include enhancing the commands and environments that the \LaTeX\ reader can comprehend, working with text analysis to improve pronunciation, and implementing a web application for users to upload their files.\\
\par
\noindent The primary priority was chosen because all secondary priorities will build upon it. Once the \LaTeX\ file can successfully get outputted in an audio response, project members will be able to build upon this framework to get an accessible and useful application. If the primary priority is not properly implemented, then project members will not be able to move forward with enhancements.

\subsection{Operating Environment}
% Describe how and where the product will be used.  
This program is expected to run online allowing any user, on a mobile or computer device, the ability to use the features regardless of operating system.
