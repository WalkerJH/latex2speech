\section{Vision of the Solution}
Begin Comment  Now that we know what the customer needs, 
Begin Comment  what will the solution look like? 
\subsection{Vision Statement}
Begin Comment  This is the formal vision statement.  
Begin Comment 
Begin Comment  For:         user class
Begin Comment  Who:         statement of need
Begin Comment  The:         title of product
Begin Comment  Is:          statement of solution
Begin Comment  Unlike:      closest alternative solution
Begin Comment  Our Product: differentiation statement  
For on the go researchers and academics who wish to increase their available paper reading time, \TeX 2Speech will provide on-demand speech synthesis for papers and a wide variety of other scientific and technical documentation written in the \LaTeX\ format. Unlike standard TTS systems, \TeX 2Speech will be able to effectively parse a \LaTeX\ document containing mathematical equations, and convert it to comprehensible spoken word.

\subsection{Major Features}
Begin Comment  Describe the major features that solve the customer's needs.
Major features include the ability to take an arbitrary \LaTeX\ document and convert it into an audio representation of the text. Major commands and environments will be supported in this conversion to benefit the majority of users. The primary feature enabling this would be our implementation to convert \LaTeX\ files into Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML), or something similar. The marked-up file would be fed to a TTS synthesis program for the audio output. Features that will be visible to the user include the option to upload their \LaTeX\ document to our service, as well as downloading the resulting audio. 

\subsection{Assumptions and Dependencies}
Begin Comment  What does this product depend on?  
Begin Comment  The goal here is to describe, with as much detail as possible, what the envisioned
Begin Comment  solution needs to operate.  
It must be assumed that users have access to the internet to utilize this program. Our service will depend both on some web hosting location, along with some cloud-based TTS service, either one failing will render our service inoperable.
\input{vision.tex}
\section{Scope and Limitations}
Begin Comment  This section identifies what part of the envisioned solution is going to be
Begin Comment  developed in this current project or version, what will be delayed until
Begin Comment  latter projects, and what is out of scope for the whole product.  
Begin Comment 
\subsection{Scope of Initial Release}
The initial release of the program will demonstrate the functionality of synthesizing audio from generic \LaTeX\ documents, with support for major commands and environments and the ability to parse common mathematical expressions. This will be hosted on a basic web service with the capability to upload \LaTeX\ files and download the resulting audio.

\subsection{Scope of Subsequent Releases}
\par
Future releases would focus on increasing the scope of environments and tools supported by \TeX 2Speech, expanding the number of accepted file formats accepted (e.g. entire compressed \LaTeX\ projects), and providing a more robust user interface for convenient reading of rendered \LaTeX\ files. Including support for one or more other languages outside the locale of English would be an important possibility to consider as well.\\
\par
\noindent The most ambitious possibility for a future release would be adding functionality to reverse engineer the \LaTeX\ source from PDFs that were generated with \LaTeX\. No accessible tools to do this currently exist, but if accomplished would expand the scope of this project to the huge number of papers/documents/textbooks for which no \LaTeX\ source exists. Even without this ambitious feature, websites like arXiv.org provide not only an enormous repository of papers but typically include their source, which will give \TeX 2Speech a huge library of files to synthesize regardless.

\subsection{Limitations and Exclusions}
Since \LaTeX\ is such an extendable language, it’s an impossibility to assume we could fully cover all environments and commands. No matter what \TeX 2Speech will operate on a “best-effort” system for unknown commands or combinations thereof.

\subsection{Key Milestones}
Begin Comment  Milestones are points in the development where you have implemented some
Begin Comment  number of major features.  For senior project, you generally have five
Begin Comment  milestones: one at the end of 491, three in 492, and one in 493.
Begin Comment  In this section, divide the Major Features between the milestones.  You should
Begin Comment  front-load the schedule as much as possible.  That is, leave 10Begin Comment  of the work
Begin Comment  for the last milestone.
Milestone 1: Research and Implement Pipeline
\begin{itemize}
    \itemsep0em
    \item Research software to use for the project
    \item Setup TTS Web Service
    \item Find a placeholder for \LaTeX\ to SSML/MathML
    \item Find a parsing service for \LaTeX\ file
    \item Create simple web service for uploading files
    \item Create list of major commands and environments in \LaTeX\
\end{itemize}
Milestone 2: Parse \LaTeX\ file to SSML/MathML
\begin{itemize}
    \itemsep0em
    \item Understand how to use parser
    \item \LaTeX\ basic commands and environments will be parsed to a marked up file
\end{itemize}
Milestone 3: Implement Base \LaTeX\ Packages
\begin{itemize}
    \itemsep0em

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Resource Assignments}
Begin Comment  Resources include budgets, consumables like paint, and computing equipment
Begin Comment  like servers and development systems.  Assign these resources, if any, to the
Begin Comment  tasks, listed above. 
Begin Comment 
The only costly resources for our project will be the cloud-based TTS service and the server that will host our \TeX 2Speech application. Our top candidate for the TTS service, Amazon Polly, has a free trial period which extends beyond the development window for the initial programs release so this resource will not be a concern for the time being. The server hosting will be a bit more problematic, but will thankfully only be essential during the final phases of development. It will primarily be needed to test the UI and request handling portions of the project, so once we reach that stage a timesheet will have to be created to allot computation time.
\subsection{Individual Responsibilities}
Begin Comment  Who is responsible for which parts of the development effort.
Begin Comment 
As it stands, the project is currently undergoing a research period leading to future possibilities in task designation. Once a suitable foundation of background knowledge and experience in each aspect of the process is gained, we will then be able to appoint individual responsibilities based on acquired expertise.\input{schedule}
\section{Deliverables}
Begin Comment  The purpose of this section is to formally list the major components that you
Begin Comment  will produce as part of this project.  

\subsection{Software/Hardware}
Begin Comment  List the software components and hardware, if any, that you will deliver as
Begin Comment  part of this project.  
\underline{\LaTeX\ to SSML Converter}: This is the largest and most fundamental piece of software we will be developing. It will contain all the rules for how different \LaTeX\ commands/syntax matches up with specifics of prosody and structure so proper pronunciation can be achieved. This piece of software will likely be further broken into several sub-modules to help aid in smooth development and managing the complexity of the task, but further research will be required to know where those distinctions will be drawn.\\
\newline
\underline{\TeX 2Speech Server}: This will be the request handling portion of the \TeX 2Speech system. It will manage interactions between users (their inputs and any files uploaded), the \LaTeX\ to SSML Converter and the TTS service upstream. While substantially simpler than the \LaTeX\ to SSML converter, its creation will still be involved and will determine how accessible our software is to use.

\subsection{Documentation}
Begin Comment  What user documentation will you deliver.
This project will include documentation regarding what features of \LaTeX\ \TeX 2Speech can support, including notable external packages and any limitations. It will specify the behavior upon encountering an error or unknown token, as well as acknowledgments of possible undefined edge cases. Along with this will be more basic documentation about how to navigate the program via its UI to upload \LaTeX\ files and get an audio output.

\subsection{Key Presentations}
Begin Comment  You will present your project at the end of 492 and 493.
\underline{End of CS 492}: We aim to present a program that converts \LaTeX\ to SSML. At this stage it will be invoked from a terminal. We will demonstrate the conversion of key \TeX\ functions to SSML using a predefined dictionary and analysis of document structure. We will then run this SSML through Amazon Polly to produce synthesized speech. \\
\newline
\underline{End of CS 493}: We will present document conversion using a more complete \TeX\ to SSML dictionary, and more sophisticated format analysis. Additionally, we will present a web application that allows users to easily convert LaTeX documents into WAV files.\input{deliverables}
