Here's a very ugly table to show different combinations of lines.

   ! Now here's some math related things. \\ 
Here's some varieties of math mode. First some line separated math modes
   <break strength="strong" />
   f of x  equals x g of x  equals
   <prosody pitch="+25%">
      <break time="0.3ms" />
      begin first parentheses
   </prosody>
   <break time="0.3ms" />
   f of x  to the power of -1
   <prosody pitch="+25%">
      <break time="0.3ms" />
      end first parentheses
   </prosody>
   <break time="0.3ms" />
   <break strength="strong" />
   and now inline math modes,   math mode equation did not render   and
   <prosody pitch="+25%">
      <break time="0.3ms" />
      begin first parentheses
   </prosody>
   <break time="0.3ms" />
   integral of  g of x  d x
   <prosody pitch="+25%">
      <break time="0.3ms" />
      end first parentheses
   </prosody>
   <break time="0.3ms" />
   equals
   <prosody pitch="+25%">
      <break time="0.3ms" />
      begin first parentheses
   </prosody>
   <break time="0.3ms" />
   log of x log of E
   <prosody pitch="+25%">
      <break time="0.3ms" />
      end first parentheses
   </prosody>
   <break time="0.3ms" />
   . For something a bit more sophisticated we have equations and theorems.
 the equation h of x  equals
   <prosody pitch="+25%">
      <break time="0.3ms" />
      begin first parentheses
   </prosody>
   <break time="0.3ms" />
   x to the power of 2
   <prosody pitch="+25%">
      <break time="0.3ms" />
      end first parentheses
   </prosody>
   <break time="0.3ms" />
   math mode equation did not render  
This is my theorem.
 
This is my corollary.
   <p>And now a couple basic formatting environments.</p>
   <p>These shouldn't change too much besides documents structure.</p>
   <p>And their typical use won't be as contrived as this.</p>
