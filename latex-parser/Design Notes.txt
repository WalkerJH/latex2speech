Exceptional Commands that Should be Handled

\par, \paragraph, \\
    - Should enclose everything from use of \par (or eqiv) to next use of \par (or equiv) 
    or if none exist then to the end of the relevant section (?) in the SSML <p>...</p> tag
\enumerate (and similar things)
    - Implicitly adds text (numbers) which should be read aloud-
    - What this text is can be modified by other commands (!!!)
